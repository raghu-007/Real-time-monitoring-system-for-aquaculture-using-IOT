# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! 🎉

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or bugfix (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. **Commit** your changes with clear, descriptive messages
4. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request**

## Guidelines

- Keep the code clean and well-commented
- Follow the existing code style (Arduino/C++ conventions)
- **Never commit secrets** — auth tokens, API keys, and passwords must go in `secrets.h` (which is `.gitignore`d)
- Test your changes on actual hardware before submitting, if possible
- Update documentation if your changes affect wiring, pin assignments, or setup steps

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](../../issues) with:
- A clear description of the problem or idea
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Your hardware setup and Arduino IDE version
